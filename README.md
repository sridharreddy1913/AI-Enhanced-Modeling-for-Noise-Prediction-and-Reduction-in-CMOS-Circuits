AI-Enhanced Modeling for Noise Prediction and Reduction in CMOS Circuits

Interference in CMOS circuit is another important aspect in system performance. When the
dimensions of the CMOS technology enter the deep nanometer range, problems such as
noise in its several forms, timing errors and power noises are among the key factors
affecting the reliability of this type of technology. This work presents development of a
machine learning (ML) – artificial intelligence (AI) based approach for noise prediction and
suppression in CMOS circuits to improve circuit stability and reliability. Both Random subset
selection via Random Forest and Gradient boosting algorithms for predicting noise were
used to examine the relationship between design and environmental factors, but Random
Forest was found more efficient. This work discusses the method used in the study, findings,
issues faced and the potential for the future expansion of the project.

The implemented noise prediction model has shown promising results in accurately
forecasting noise levels in CMOS circuits and effectively smoothing out variabilities. The
Random Forest model, in particular, demonstrated superior performance, making it ideal for
this task. This model can help in designing CMOS circuits with enhanced noise management
and prediction capabilities, improving their stability and performance.
